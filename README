This plugin allows you to use RFormation forms from Rails. It adds a
new templating engine so you can create views with extension rfrm that
use the RFormation DSL.

What you get when you use this plugin is:

* A powerful DSL to create forms. We are constantly extending the DSL to
  increase the expressive power.
* Specify validations once in the DSL and they will be used both client
  side and server side. Both happen transparently.
* RFormation does not generate full forms; it generates only the body, so
  you can use RFormation for any type of form that Rails provide, such as
  regular forms and Ajax forms.
* The forms are filled in from both instance variables and local variables,
  whichever has the right name.

What you need to use this plugin:

* The plugin has been tested with version 2.2.2 of Rails. We will lower this
  requirement once we have tested the plugin with lower versions of Rails.
* At least version 0.4.8 of RFormation.
