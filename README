This plugin allows you to use RFormation forms from Rails. It adds a
new templating engine so you can create views with extension rfrm that
use the RFormation DSL.

What you get when you use this plugin is:

* A powerful DSL to create forms. We are constantly extending the DSL to
  increase the expressive power.
* Specify validations once in the DSL and they will be used both client
  side and server side. Both happen transparently.
* RFormation does not generate full forms; it generates only the body, so
  you can use RFormation for any type of form that Rails provide, such as
  regular forms and Ajax forms.
* The forms are filled in from both instance variables and local variables,
  whichever has the right name.

What you need to use this plugin:

* The plugin has been tested with version 2.2.2 of Rails. We will lower this
  requirement once we have tested the plugin with lower versions of Rails.
* At least version 0.4.8 of RFormation.

How to get going:

* Install the plugin (this will probably change when the plugin goes public):
    script/plugin install git@github.com:xaop/rformation_rails_plugin.git
* Create a controller FormController
* Create an action in FormController
    def form
      @name = "name"
      @address = "address"
    end
* Create a view to go with this action, e.g., app/views/form/form.html.haml with
  the following contents:
    - form_tag "submit_form" do
      = render :partial => "form"
      = submit_tag "Submit"
* Create the partial for the form as app/views/form/_form.html.rfrm with the
  following content:
    text "name" do
      mandatory
      label "Your name"
    end
    text "address" do
      label "Your address"
    end
* Create the submit_form action
    def submit_form
      if params[:form_errors].blank?
        # do something with params[:name] and params[:address]
      else
        # There were validation errors. params[:form_errors] is
        # a Hash with the field labels as keys and arrays of errors
        # as values.
      end
    end
* Visit the URL for the action, fill out the form and submit
*
